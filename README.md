Image recognition through iPhone camera using resnet50 data model

The project uses ResNet50 data model provided by Apple (https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/models/) 

iPhone's camera is accessed using AVKit library

Apple's Vision library is used to identify the objects with the help of ResNet 50 as the data model

Main screen shows camera view and object's identification with a percenage of confidence level

A seperate screen makes a list of all the objects identified with their confidence levels
